Pretty much feature complete on the original concept, so not exactly a
ToDo more of a place to record possible enhancements.

- Add a mode to support an additional switch to choose between
  multiple MIDI channels, each channel could have own min/max range
  and track last PC sent. Could use multi-colour LED or additional
  7-SEG digit or additional data on OLED.
  Would probably need more program FLASH.

- Low power/Sleep if on battery power. Probably not worth the
  time/effort, batteries not good for environment.

- Send on multiple/all channels at once.
